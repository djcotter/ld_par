In order to generate the filter files in this directory
the raw data from UCSC's table browser must be concatanated, sorted, and merged.

This can be done by concatanating all relevant bed files from the raw_UCSC_bed_files directory.

cat a.bed b.bed c.bed > filter_unsorted.bed

Then the file has to be sorted.

sort -k1,1 -k2,2n filter_unmerged.bed

Then it must be cut down to the same number of columns to be interpeted by bedtools.

cat filter_unmerged.bed | awk '{print $1 "\t" $2 "\t" $3 "\t" $4}' > filter_unmerged_4C.bed

Finally, bedtools merge can be run to create the final filter file.

bedtools merge -i filter_unmerged_4C.bed > filter.bed

#############################################################

To create the flanked refseq gene intervals, bedtools flank can be used.
A genome file must be assigned to use this tool. This is availabe in ~/downloads/bedtools2/genomes/
The usage is bedtools flank -i INPUT.bed -g my.genome -b [Number of bp to flank] > OUTPUT.bed
